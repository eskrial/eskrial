### 👋 Hello there.

What you’ll find here matters more than who I am — so let’s start with that.

This GitHub profile contains small to medium‑sized hobby projects, experiments, and things I build out of curiosity or for learning purposes. Nothing huge or production‑grade is planned here (at least for now), but you’ll find a mix of practical tools, prototypes, and explorations across design and development.

### 📂 What You Can Expect Here
- Utility scripts and small tools
- Web development experiments
- Design concepts and prototypes

### 🧩 About Me

I studied design and programming, which means that I enjoy working at the interface between aesthetics, user-friendliness, and technical implementation.
I am currently involved in setting up medical infrastructure, specifically configuring IT networks for medical practices and medical care centers.

### 🛠️ Tech & Interests
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Astro, Vue.js
- Design: CX/UX/UI, prototyping, Figma
- Infrastructure: networking, server basics, IT security fundamentals
I enjoy solving problems, building intuitive systems, and learning new technologies along the way.
